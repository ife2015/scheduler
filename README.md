# Interview Scheduler

Using the latest tools and techniques, I built and tested a React application that allows students to create, book, edit, and delete interview appointments with a mentor between noon and 5pm. I combined a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience. 

- Build components in isolation.
- Retrieve data from an API and render it using components.
- Manage the visual state of the appointment including create, edit and delete capabilities.
- Use more advanced React patterns to manage the state and add live updates.
